# Documentation for `hudsnote` Script

## Overview

The `hudsnote` tool is designed to streamline data entry through a command-line interface (CLI), facilitating the collection of structured data by reading questions or fields stored in a file and presenting them to a user. The tool is especially useful in the context of threat intelligence gathering and investigation, as it ensures consistency in the data collection process. The collected data is formatted into JSON, which can then be easily converted to STIX, CSV, or other formats suitable for integration into a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) repository.

## Usefulness

### Key Benefits

1. **Consistency:** Ensures that all necessary fields are completed uniformly, reducing the chances of missing critical information.
2. **Efficiency:** Speeds up the data collection process by automating the presentation of questions and the recording of responses.
3. **Integration:** Outputs data in JSON format, which can be easily converted to other formats such as STIX or CSV, and subsequently integrated into CTI repositories for further analysis and action.

### Application in Threat Intelligence

When investigating cybersecurity incidents, having a structured and consistent method for collecting data is crucial. The `hudsnote` tool allows analysts to gather detailed information about incidents, such as alert names, timestamps, user details, and other relevant fields. This structured data can then be analyzed, correlated with other data sources, and used to build a comprehensive threat landscape.

Once collected, the JSON data can be converted into STIX (Structured Threat Information Expression) format, a standardized language for representing threat intelligence information. Alternatively, the data can be exported as CSV for use in spreadsheets or other tools. This flexibility ensures that the collected intelligence can be used effectively in various CTI workflows.

## Usage

### Command-Line Arguments

The script accepts the following command-line arguments:

- `-s, --source_input_file`: Specify a source input file name or path (required).
- `-fd, --field_delimiter`: Specify field delimiter (default: `_`).
- `-d, --destination_output_file`: Specify a destination output file name or path (optional).
- `-V, --validate_destination_output_file`: Validate destination output file name or path.
- `-c, --create_new_qb_file`: Create a new question book `.qb` file.
- `-R, --readme`: Short notes on how to use the app.
- `-D, --delete_file_after_run`: Delete the file after execution.
- `-N, --ntp_server`: Specify an NTP server for configuration (default: `1.asia.pool.ntp.org`).
- `-L, --license_token`: Supply license token from author.
- `-S, --make_destination_file_static`: Make the destination file static.

### Running the Script

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python hudsnote.py -s <source_input_file>
```

For example:

```bash
python hudsnote.py -s questions.qb -d output.json -N 0.pool.ntp.org -L <license_token>
```

## User Guide

### Preparing the Source Input File

Create a source input file (e.g., `questions.qb`) containing the fields or questions you want to collect answers for. The format should follow these guidelines:

- **Comments:** Lines starting with `#` are comments and will be ignored.
- **Mandatory Fields:** Lines starting with `###` are mandatory fields and must be completed by the user. Ensure all mandatory fields are on one line, separated by commas.
- **Optional Fields:** Other lines are considered optional fields.

#### Example:

```plaintext
# These fields are required and must be completed
### alert name, alert id, timestamp, user name, host name, source ip, source domain, revision status

# Data source: Endgame(EDR)

### Running the Script

To start the data entry process, run the script with the required arguments. For example:

```bash
python hudsnote.py -s questions.qb
```

### Data Entry Process

1. **Starting Data Entry:**
   - After starting the script, you will be prompted to type `yes` to begin data entry or `exit` to terminate the script.

2. **Entering Data:**
   - For each field, you will be prompted to provide an answer.
   - Hit the `[ENTER]` key once to move to the next field/question when the field/question is empty.
   - Hit the `[ENTER] key twice to move to the next field/question when the field/question is not empty.

3. **Special Commands During Data Entry:**
   - `=back`: Move back to the previous field/question. Confirm by hitting the `[Enter]` key twice.
   - `=clear`: Clear the screen.
   - `=save`: Save the current content mid-way. At the end of the input process, a prompt will request you to confirm saving.
   - `=usage`: Display the help menu.

4. **Handling Mandatory Fields:**
   - If you encounter a mandatory field (starting with `###`), the script will force you to provide input before proceeding.

5. **Confirming Data Entry:**
   - After completing the data entry, the script will display the collected data and ask for confirmation to save it.

### Saving Data

At the end of the data entry process, the script will prompt you to confirm if the collected data inputs are valid. Type `yes` to save the data to the specified output file or `no` to exit without saving.

### Validating Output File

If the `-V` or `--validate_destination_output_file` argument is provided, the script will validate the JSON content in the specified output file. This is useful to ensure that the output data is properly formatted and free from errors.

### Self-Deletion

If the `-D` or `--delete_file_after_run` argument is provided, the script will delete itself after execution. This can be useful for maintaining security or cleaning up after the script has run.

## Additional Notes

- **Source Input File:** Ensure the source input file contains valid fields or questions.
- **Mandatory Fields:** Mandatory fields should be marked with `###` and be on a single line, separated by commas.
- **Special Commands:** The script supports various commands during data entry (`=back`, `=clear`, `=save`, and `=usage`) to help navigate and manage the process.
- **Licensing:** Make sure to provide the correct license token if required.

## Potential Improvements

While the `hudsnote` tool is highly effective, there are several ways it could be enhanced:

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Developing a GUI version could make the tool more user-friendly, especially for non-technical users.
2. **Automated Data Validation:** Implementing more robust data validation checks to ensure data integrity before saving.
3. **Database Integration:** Adding direct integration with databases like MongoDB or Elasticsearch to save data in real-time.
4. **Enhanced Error Handling:** Improving error messages and handling to provide more informative feedback to the user.
5. **Configuration Files:** Allowing users to specify configuration settings in a separate file to simplify command-line usage.
6. **Export Formats:** Providing additional export options, such as direct conversion to STIX or CSV within the tool.
7. **Multi-Language Support:** Adding support for multiple languages to make the tool accessible to a broader audience.
8. **Templates:** Including predefined templates for common data collection tasks to streamline setup for new users.
9. **Integration with CTI Platforms:** Developing plugins or connectors for popular CTI platforms to facilitate seamless data transfer.

Implementing these improvements could significantly enhance the functionality and user experience of the `hudsnote` tool, making it even more valuable for threat intelligence and other data collection tasks.
